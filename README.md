## What is a trading plan?

Having a suitable trading plan is one of the most important aspects of trading. It is vital for your trading plan to be ***personal to you***. It's no good copying someone else's plan, because that person will very likely have different goals, attitudes and ideas to you.

### Difference between a trading strategy, a trading plan and a trading diary

* ***A trading strategy*** defines precisely how you should enter and exit trades. For example, 'Buy gold when it drops below $1250, sell when it....'
* ***A trading plan*** is a comprehensive blueprint covering everything from your goals, motivation and attitude to risk, through to risk management rules and analysis of past trades.
* ***A trading diary*** is a written record of everything that happens when you trade, including entry and exit points, profit/loss, trading statistics and even your emotional state before, during and after each trade.

### Why is a trading plan important?

* ***It makes trading easier***: A trading plan gives you guidance on when and how you should trade.
* ***It helps you trade without emotion***: A plan can remove emotional decision-making in the heat of the moment. Realistically, markets can only go up or down, so you should be able to plan for every eventuality beforehand.
* ***It helps you maintain discipline***: Anyone can get lucky on a few trades, but a disciplined trader is much more likely to be ***profitable*** in the long run. By maintaining discipline and sticking to your plan, you could potentially turn a losing strategy into a winning one, or at least discover how and why it wasn't successful.
* ***It enables you to improve***: By following a trading plan, and maintaining a trading diary, you can keep a record of what works for you and what doesn't.

## How to make a trading plan?

### Motivation

* Whatever your reason for becoming a trader, it is a good idea to write it down because your motivation is an essential part of who you are as a trader.

### Time commitment

* Before you get down to the real business of trading, it's sensible to work out how much time you can commit to it.
