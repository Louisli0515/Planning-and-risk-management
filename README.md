## What is a trading plan?

Having a suitable trading plan is one of the most important aspects of trading. It is vital for your trading plan to be ***personal to you***. It's no good copying someone else's plan, because that person will very likely have different goals, attitudes and ideas to you.

### Difference between a trading strategy, a trading plan and a trading diary

* ***A trading strategy*** defines precisely how you should enter and exit trades. For example, 'Buy gold when it drops below $1250, sell when it....'
* ***A trading plan*** is a comprehensive blueprint covering everything from your goals, motivation and attitude to risk, through to risk management rules and analysis of past trades.
* ***A trading diary*** is a written record of everything that happens when you trade, including entry and exit points, profit/loss, trading statistics and even your emotional state before, during and after each trade.

### Why is a trading plan important?

* ***It makes trading easier***: A trading plan gives you guidance on when and how you should trade.
* ***It helps you trade without emotion***: A plan can remove emotional decision-making in the heat of the moment. Realistically, markets can only go up or down, so you should be able to plan for every eventuality beforehand.
* ***It helps you maintain discipline***: Anyone can get lucky on a few trades, but a disciplined trader is much more likely to be ***profitable*** in the long run. By maintaining discipline and sticking to your plan, you could potentially turn a losing strategy into a winning one, or at least discover how and why it wasn't successful.
* ***It enables you to improve***: By following a trading plan, and maintaining a trading diary, you can keep a record of what works for you and what doesn't.

## How to make a trading plan?

### Motivation

* Whatever your reason for becoming a trader, it is a good idea to write it down because your motivation is an essential part of who you are as a trader.

### Time commitment

* Before you get down to the real business of trading, it's sensible to work out how much time you can commit to it.
* Individuals looking to make a large number of trades per day, for example, will need to dedicate a lot more time to trading than investors looking to buy assets that will appreciate over several years.
* It's also important to spend enough time preparing yourself for trading, which includes education, practising your strategies and analysing the markets.

### Trading goals

* To be effective, trading goals need to be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound. In short, they need to be SMART:
* ***S***: Specific;
* ***M****: Measurable;
* ***A***: Attainable;
* ***R***: Relevant;
* ***T****: Time-Bound

### Attitude to risk

* Market prices are always changing and even the safest financial instruments carry some degree of risk.
* Before you start trading, it is important to work out how much risk you are prepared to take on, both for each individual trade and over your trading strategy as a whole.
* Your attitude to risk usually goes hand-in-hand with your trading goals.

### Trading capital

* Specifically your money and how much of it you can afford to dedicate to trading. This is your ***trading capital***.
* It should go without saying, but it's vital that you ***don't risk more than you can afford to lose***.
* You always need to make sure you can afford the maximum potential loss on every trade, so do the maths every time you open a position.

### Markets to trade

* Research is an essential part of trading, so it makes sense to begin by looking at the markets you have a particular interest in.
* It is also crucial to look at: ***Trading times***; ***Volatility***, on average, how many points does this market move in an hour/day/week; ***Position/contract size***, how much will you gain or lose for every point of movement in the price?
* If these factors don't fit with how you want to trade, or your attitude

### Record keeping 

* For a trading plan to work, it needs to be backed up by a trading diary. This is where you record everything that happens during a trade, including why you entered it, the expected profit and maximum risk, the entry point, exit point and how the market behaved during the trade.
* Record keeping also enables you to see how you are performing over a period of time: Are you generally profitable or are you losing money? What's your win percentage? When you win, is it usually by more or less than when you lose? Are particular markets/times of day/trade setups more profitable than others?

## What is risk management?

* One of the key parts to a successful trading plan is to ensure you manage your risk properly because, as any trader who's been in the game for long enough will know, you can't get it right every time.
* Risk is defined as ***the potential for the actual return on an investment to be lower than the expected return***.

### Market risk

The four factors that have the greatest impact on market prices are:

* Interest rates;
* Stock prices;
* Foreign exchange rates;
* Commodity prices

* As most commodities are denominated in US dollars, the strength of the dollar will have a significant bearing on commodity prices and in turn the stock itself.

### Liquidity risk

This is the risk that you can't buy or sell an asset quickly enough to prevent a loss. There are two main types:

* ***Asset liquidity risk***: the asset's ability to be traded in the market. For example, you hold a little-known stock and nobody wants to buy it, you may be forced to sell at a less favourable price. This type of risk tends only to be an ***issue in emerging*** or ***low-volume markets***.
* ***Funding liquidity risk***: it is the potential for loss if one of the parties involved in a trade cannot meet their financial obligations when they need to. The resulting time delay could have an impact on market prices, or may cause the trade to fall through altogether.

### Systemic risk

* Systemic risk is the risk that the entire financial system will be affected by a particular event or series of events.
* This occurred during the global financial crisis of 2008, where subprime debt issues and the subsequent collapse of major financial institutions, such as Lehman Brothers, caused stock markets to drop worldwide.
* Systemic risk is often very difficult to protect yourself against. Other examples of systemic risk can include natural disasters, war and major political or regulatory change.

## Ways to manage risk: part one

### Always be aware of the downside

* Before you place every trade you should calculate exactly how much you stand to lose in the worst case scenario.
* You need to keep the worst case scenario in mind, because if there's a major market event, you may be overly exposed. This is particularly important to remember when placing ***leveraged trades***, where your losses could be greater than your deposit.

### Avoid emotional trading

* When making trading decisions, you should distinguish between those which are rational and those which are emotional.
* Creating a structured plan can help you manage emotional risk by providing clear guidelines and helping you maintain your discipline.

### Diversify

* If you often have more than one position open at any one time, you can help minimise risk by putting your money into a broad range of different investments - i.e., not putting all your eggs in one basket.
* However, even spreading your capital across a range of different shares can't protect you from systemic risk factors that can affect the stock market as a whole.
* Therefore, the best way to ***diversify*** is to spread your investment across asset classes. For example, you may end up having a portfolio made up of shares, commodities, property, bonds and other investments. These markets often move ***independently*** of each other, providing protection against one particular asset class underperforming.

### Select riskier investments carefully

* If you do end up having a portfolio of different investments, it's sensible to balance out any particularly risky trades with more stable assets.
* The investment risk pyramid is a handy model to help you decide how to spread your risk across various financial instruments.

* Most traders will probably want to keep the bulk of their investments in safe assets that provide regular returns. These are represented by the pyramid's ***base***.
* In the middle there are medium-risk assets, which should provide a ***stable return*** and also have the ***potential*** to rise.
* At the top are higher-risk investments which have the potential for ***huge returns*** but ***large losses*** too. The money you put into these high-risk assets should only be money that you can afford to lose without serious financial repercussions.

## Ways to manage risk: part two

### Calculate your maximum risk per trade

* Some guidance says that don't risk more than ***1%*** of your trading capital per trade, while others say it's ok to go up to ***10%***.
* If you go on a big losing streak, the amount you're risking per trade will have a huge effect on your capital and the ability to claw back your losses.
* Say you have got $10,000 of trading capital and you are unlucky enough to lose 15 trades in a row. Here's the difference between risking 2%, 5% or 10% per trade.

<img src = 'https://github.com/Louisli0515/Planning-and-risk-management/assets/128298224/7189976b-3687-4af9-8c11-55c7296c9845' width = 75% height = 75%>

* With 2% risk per trade, even after 15 losses you've lost less than 25% of your trading capital. It is conceivable that you can win this money back.
* However, if you'd gone for 5% risk per trade, you'd have lost ***over half*** your initial trading capital. You'd have to more than double this amount to get to your original level.
* With 10% risk per trade, you'd down ***over 75%*** making it extremely difficult to make back the money you've lost.

* The reduction of capital after a series of losing trades is called a ***drawdown***. Based on this information, you can also work out a ***risk-per-trade*** scale.

<img src = 'https://github.com/Louisli0515/Planning-and-risk-management/assets/128298224/867f99d3-6ad7-4b62-ba01-d4eef08e2d2c' width = 75% height = 75%>

### Work out the risk vs reward ratio of every trade

* It is possible to lose more times than you win, yet be consistently profitable. It's all down to risk vs reward.
* To find the ratio on a particular trade, simply compare the amount of money you're risking to the potential gain.
* A word of warning though: if you are taking on less risk for a greater potential reward, it's likely the market will have to move further in your favour to reach your maximum profit, than it will to hit your maximum loss.

## Choosing your trading style

* When we talk about different trading styles, we are basically referring to ***how often*** you place a trade, and ***how long*** you keep those trades running.
* Your ***personality*** will also have a big influence over your trading style.

### The four main styles

<img src = 'https://github.com/Louisli0515/Planning-and-risk-management/assets/128298224/82a026ac-f2f4-4cef-a9f1-df5bfdc27cd9' width = 75% height = 75%>

## Position and swing trading

### Position trading

* ***Investing*** is the most recognised and traditional form of position trading, with a great many people holding long-term investments in share portfolios, funds or pension plans.
* Before entering a trade, a position trader will often spend a considerable amount of time studying the ***fundamentals*** of the asset they're going to be trading.
* Because of the long-term nature of these transactions, position traders tend to risk a lot more per trade than other types of trader - though with the expectation of making greater profits. Which means to be successful you need to have ***patience***, and not get spooked by short-term market moves.
* When holding a trade for a long time, it is almost ***inevitable*** that the market will move in an unfavourable direction at some point. In these circumstances you need to have the ***resolve and conviction*** to follow the rules set out in your trading plan, waiting for the market to turn back in your favour if required.
* What's more, if trading using leverage, you need to make sure you have ***enough starting capital*** to weather any large unfabourable price swings.

### Swing trading 

* Swing trading involves holding positions over several days or weeks, in an attempt to take advantage of ***medium-term*** market moves. It's the ideal style for people who want to trade fairly frequently but don't have time to spend all day monitoring the markets.
* Both ***fundamental*** and ***technical*** analysis (the study of market movements using charts) are commonly used for swing trading, with technical analysis particularly useful for establishing stop and limit levels.

### Market gaps

* Market gaps occur when the price of an asset makes a sharp jump from one level to another without any trading in between.
* These tend to occur between trading sessions, for example if the closing price of an asset one day is ***significantly higher*** or ***lower*** than its opening price of the next.
* Market gaps can be caused by ***earning results***, ***geopolitcal events***, ***regular buying/selling pressure*** or any major news announcement with the power to move the markets.
* They often occur in the equity and commodity markets, but are ***rarer*** in ***forex*** since it is highly liquid and trades 24 hours a day.

 ## Day trading and scalping

 ### Day trading

 * This type of trading involves opening and closing a ***small number of trades*** in the same day.
 * Positions are not held overnight, eliminating the exposure to large overnight moves when it could be difficult or impossible to get out of the trade - e.g. if you are in bed, or the underlying market is closed.
 * This means day trading tends to be a very ***time-intensive*** activity, often requiring traders to check market prices, news and data regular looking for entry opportunities and exit strategies.
 * Day traders tend to rely on ***technical analysis*** more than ***fundamental analysis***, as emerging chart patterns and indicators can often provide strong short-term signals to trade.
 * However, if you decide to trade using this style, it's still very important to know which major ***economic events*** are coming up each day, as these frequently cause market volatility and significant shifts in sentiment and momentum.

### Scalping

* Scalping is the ***shortest-term*** style of trading and involves placing dozens, sometimes hundreds of trades per day. Each trade is usually held from between just ***a few seconds***, to ***a few minutes*** at the most.
* If the market moves against you at any time, you close the trade and take a ***small loss***.
* Pick a market trending in a particular direction so you end up ***winning more trades than you lose***. If the trend changes direction, you change the direction of your trades as well.
* Scalping is an extremely intense form of trading requiring high levels of concentration over an extended period of time.
* The best time to trade is generally when the market is trending strongly ***up or down*** and there's a lot of ***liquidity***.
* When scalping you need to be particularly ***disciplned*** and not get ***distracted*** by chasing large profits or letting losses run.
* Due to the very short-term nature of the trades, scalpers tend to use ***technical chart analysis*** almost exclusively to identiy trending markets.
* However, you still need to be aware of which economic announcements are scehduled for that day, as any surprising data could cause markets to gap, or trends to reverse.
