## What is a trading plan?

Having a suitable trading plan is one of the most important aspects of trading. It is vital for your trading plan to be ***personal to you***. It's no good copying someone else's plan, because that person will very likely have different goals, attitudes and ideas to you.

### Difference between a trading strategy, a trading plan and a trading diary

* ***A trading strategy*** defines precisely how you should enter and exit trades. For example, 'Buy gold when it drops below $1250, sell when it....'
* ***A trading plan*** is a comprehensive blueprint covering everything from your goals, motivation and attitude to risk, through to risk management rules and analysis of past trades.
* ***A trading diary*** is a written record of everything that happens when you trade, including entry and exit points, profit/loss, trading statistics and even your emotional state before, during and after each trade.

### Why is a trading plan important?

* ***It makes trading easier***: A trading plan gives you guidance on when and how you should trade.
* ***It helps you trade without emotion***: A plan can remove emotional decision-making in the heat of the moment. Realistically, markets can only go up or down, so you should be able to plan for every eventuality beforehand.
* ***It helps you maintain discipline***: Anyone can get lucky on a few trades, but a disciplined trader is much more likely to be ***profitable*** in the long run. By maintaining discipline and sticking to your plan, you could potentially turn a losing strategy into a winning one, or at least discover how and why it wasn't successful.
* ***It enables you to improve***: By following a trading plan, and maintaining a trading diary, you can keep a record of what works for you and what doesn't.

## How to make a trading plan?

### Motivation

* Whatever your reason for becoming a trader, it is a good idea to write it down because your motivation is an essential part of who you are as a trader.

### Time commitment

* Before you get down to the real business of trading, it's sensible to work out how much time you can commit to it.
* Individuals looking to make a large number of trades per day, for example, will need to dedicate a lot more time to trading than investors looking to buy assets that will appreciate over several years.
* It's also important to spend enough time preparing yourself for trading, which includes education, practising your strategies and analysing the markets.

### Trading goals

* To be effective, trading goals need to be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound. In short, they need to be SMART:
* ***S***: Specific;
* ***M****: Measurable;
* ***A***: Attainable;
* ***R***: Relevant;
* ***T****: Time-Bound

### Attitude to risk

* Market prices are always changing and even the safest financial instruments carry some degree of risk.
* Before you start trading, it is important to work out how much risk you are prepared to take on, both for each individual trade and over your trading strategy as a whole.
* Your attitude to risk usually goes hand-in-hand with your trading goals.

### Trading capital

* Specifically your money and how much of it you can afford to dedicate to trading. This is your ***trading capital***.
* It should go without saying, but it's vital that you ***don't risk more than you can afford to lose***.
* You always need to make sure you can afford the maximum potential loss on every trade, so do the maths every time you open a position.

### Markets to trade

* Research is an essential part of trading, so it makes sense to begin by looking at the markets you have a particular interest in.
* It is also crucial to look at: ***Trading times***; ***Volatility***, on average, how many points does this market move in an hour/day/week; ***Position/contract size***, how much will you gain or lose for every point of movement in the price?
* If these factors don't fit with how you want to trade, or your attitude

### Record keeping 

* For a trading plan to work, it needs to be backed up by a trading diary. This is where you record everything that happens during a trade, including why you entered it, the expected profit and maximum risk, the entry point, exit point and how the market behaved during the trade.
* Record keeping also enables you to see how you are performing over a period of time: Are you generally profitable or are you losing money? What's your win percentage? When you win, is it usually by more or less than when you lose? Are particular markets/times of day/trade setups more profitable than others?

## What is risk management?

* One of the key parts to a successful trading plan is to ensure you manage your risk properly because, as any trader who's been in the game for long enough will know, you can't get it right every time.
